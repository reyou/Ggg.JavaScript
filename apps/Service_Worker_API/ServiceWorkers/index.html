        Developer tools - Chrome has
        <b>chrome://inspect/#service-workers</b>, which shows current service worker activity and storage on a device, and
        <b>chrome://serviceworker-internals</b>, which shows more detail and allows you to start/stop/debug the worker process.
        In the future they will have throttling/offline modes to simulate bad or non-existent connections, which will be
        a really good thing.
