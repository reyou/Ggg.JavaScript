What is a closure?
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing)
function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access
to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets),it has access to the
outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but
also to the outer function’s parameters. Note that the inner function cannot
call the outer function’s arguments object, however, even though it can call the
outer function’s parameters directly.

You create a closure by adding a function inside another function.
