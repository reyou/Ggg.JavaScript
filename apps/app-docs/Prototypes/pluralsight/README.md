Understanding Javascript Prototypes

//=============================================================================
If you aren't familiar at all with prototypes, they come into play when you
start working with objects and inheritance in JavaScript.
//=============================================================================
So let's give an actual definition to each of these terms:

A function's prototype: A function's prototype is the object instance that
will become the prototype for all objects created using this function
as a constructor.

An object's prototype: An object prototype is the object instance from
which the object is inherited.
//=============================================================================
it is safe to say that all objects eventually inherit from Object.
